# Ask Pattern

The ask pattern provides request–response semantics between actors. An actor sends a message and waits for a reply, typically by using a future or awaiting a `Task`.

## Basic Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Caller
    participant Target
    Caller->>Target: Request
    Target-->>Caller: Response
```

In Proto.Actor you can use `Context.Request` when the sender expects the recipient to know who sent the message. For an awaitable response, `Context.RequestAsync<T>` or `PID.RequestAsync<T>` returns a `Task<T>` that completes when the reply arrives.

```csharp
// ask a target actor for a reply
var response = await pid.RequestAsync<MyReply>(new MyRequest());
```

## When to Use
- Querying another actor for state or service results.
- Bridging between actor code and external await-based APIs.
- Providing back-pressure by limiting concurrent pending requests.

## Tell, Don't Ask
In an asynchronous system it's often better to emit events about your state
rather than having others ask for it. By telling peers about changes, actors
stay loosely coupled and can react when they are ready.

```mermaid
graph LR
    producer((Producer))
    consumer((Consumer))
    evt(StateChanged)

    class producer green
    class consumer green
    class evt message

    producer -- emits --> evt
    evt --> consumer

```

```csharp
public class Counter : IActor
{
    private int _value;

    public Task ReceiveAsync(IContext context)
    {
        switch (context.Message)
        {
            case Increment _:
                _value++;
                // tell others instead of expecting them to ask
                EventStream.Instance.Publish(new CountChanged(_value));
                break;
        }
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

Listeners subscribe to the emitted events and can maintain local state without
performing additional request–response roundtrips.

## Reentrancy and Ask
Waiting on `RequestAsync` inside an actor's receive method suspends message processing until the task completes. Combine the ask pattern with [Reentrancy](reenter.md) (`RequestReenter` or `ReenterAfter`) to keep the actor responsive. Without reentrancy, the actor cannot handle other messages and may cause a deadlock.

## Deadlock Example
```mermaid
graph LR
    A((Actor A))
    B((Actor B))
    req1(Request)
    req2(Request)

    class A green
    class B green
    class req1 message
    class req2 message

    A --> req1 --> B
    B --> req2 --> A
```
If Actor A awaits a reply from Actor B while B simultaneously awaits a reply from A, neither actor can proceed. Reentrancy or redesigning the communication flow breaks the cycle.

See [Actor Communication](communication.md) for an overview of messaging APIs and [PID](pid.md) for additional request options.
