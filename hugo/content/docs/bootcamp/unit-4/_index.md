# Module 4: Creating actor hierarchy and error handling.

## Concepts you'll learn.

In this module, we will learn how to create a hierarchy of actors and how to restore actors after a failure. To demonstrate the features of the Proto.Actor platform, we will create our streaming system for watching movies based on the actor hierarchy. You'll see how Proto.Actor takes on all the low-level work of supporting the actor hierarchy and recovering actors after a crash. 

You will also learn what a supervisor is and what actor-recovery strategies the Proto.Actor platform offers. At the end of this chapter, you will learn how to create your own actor recovery strategies, depending on the type of exception.
