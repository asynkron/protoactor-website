# Getting Started With Grains / Virtual Actors (Go)

In this tutorial we will:

1. Model smart bulbs and a smart house using virtual actors/grains.
2. Run these grains in a cluster of members (nodes).
3. Send messages to and between these grains.
4. Host everything in a simple Go app.

The code from this tutorial is available on GitHub: [Go version](https://github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go/tree/dev/examples/cluster-grain) | [.NET version](https://github.com/asynkron/protoactor-dotnet/tree/dev/examples/ClusterGrainHelloWorld).

## Setting up the project

First things first, let's get the project setup and basic configuration out of the way, so we can later focus on grains and clustering.

### Required packages

Create a folder named `proto-cluster-tutorial` and initialize a Go module:

```bash
go mod init github.com/you/proto-cluster-tutorial
```

We'll need the following packages:

- `github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go/actor`
- `github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go/cluster`
- `github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go/remote`
- `github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go/cluster/clusterproviders/consul` (for development we can keep everything local)
- `github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go/cluster/identitylookup/disthash`

Install them using `go get`:

```bash
go get github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go@latest
```

### Base app

Let's establish what our base app code should look like. Create a `main.go` file:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Proto.Cluster!")
}
```

Try running your app to see if everything works so far.

### Basic Proto.Cluster infrastructure and configuration

First, we'll get the basic infrastructure of the cluster going.

We need to create, configure and start an `ActorSystem`. We'll also configure the remote and cluster components.

`main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go/actor"
    "github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go/cluster"
    "github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go/cluster/clusterproviders/consul"
    "github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go/cluster/identitylookup/disthash"
    "github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go/remote"
)

func main() {
    system := actor.NewActorSystem()

    provider, _ := consul.New()
    lookup := disthash.New()
    remoteConfig := remote.Configure("localhost", 0)

    clusterConfig := cluster.Configure("ProtoClusterTutorial", provider, lookup, remoteConfig)
    c := cluster.New(system, clusterConfig)

    c.StartMember()
    fmt.Println("Cluster member started. Press Enter to exit...")
    fmt.Scanln()
    c.Shutdown(true)
}
```

Let's go through each configuration section one by one:

#### Actor System configuration

This is a standard Proto.Actor configuration. It's out of the scope for this tutorial; if you want to learn more, you should check out the [Actors](../actors.md) section of Proto.Actor's documentation.

#### Remote configuration

Proto.Cluster uses Proto.Remote for transport. Again, its configuration is out of scope for this tutorial; if you want to learn more, you should check out the [Remote](../remote.md) section of Proto.Actor's documentation.

#### Cluster configuration

This is where we configure Proto.Cluster. Let's explain its parameters:

1. `clusterName` - any name will do.
2. `clusterProvider` - a Cluster Provider is an abstraction that provides information about currently available members (nodes) in a cluster. Since right now our cluster only has one member, it's ok to use a [Consul provider](consul-net.md).
3. `identityLookup` - an Identity Lookup is an abstraction that allows a cluster to locate grains. `disthash` is generally a good choice for most cases. You can read more about Identity Lookup [here](identity-lookup-net.md).

### Cluster object

Most of the time we'll want to interact with the cluster, we will use a `Cluster` object. You can get it from an `ActorSystem` instance:

```go
import "github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go/cluster"

// ...

c := cluster.New(system, clusterConfig)
```

### Starting a cluster member

Cluster members need to be explicitly started and shut down. In the sample above, `StartMember` and `Shutdown` take care of it.

## Implementing grains

Now that the infrastructure is in place we can create grains. We'll model a smart bulb that can be turned on and off and can report its state.

### Define messages and grain contract

Create a file named `smartbulb.proto`:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";
package smartbulb;
option go_package = "github.com/you/proto-cluster-tutorial/smartbulb";

import "google/protobuf/empty.proto";

message GetStateResponse {
  bool isOn = 1;
}

service SmartBulb {
  rpc TurnOn(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
  rpc TurnOff(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
  rpc GetState(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (GetStateResponse);
}
```

Once you have this, you can generate your code using `protoc`:

```bash
protoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative \
    --plugin=protoc-gen-go-grain=PATH_TO_PROTOC_GEN_GO_GRAIN \
    --go-grain_out=. --go-grain_opt=paths=source_relative \
    smartbulb.proto
```

### Implementing the grain

When the contracts have been generated, you can start implementing your grain:

```go
package smartbulb

import (
    "github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go/cluster"
    "google.golang.org/protobuf/types/known/emptypb"
)

type Bulb struct {
    on bool
}

func (b *Bulb) Init(ctx cluster.GrainContext)           {}
func (b *Bulb) Terminate(ctx cluster.GrainContext)      {}
func (b *Bulb) ReceiveDefault(ctx cluster.GrainContext) {}

func (b *Bulb) TurnOn(_ *emptypb.Empty, ctx cluster.GrainContext) (*emptypb.Empty, error) {
    b.on = true
    return &emptypb.Empty{}, nil
}

func (b *Bulb) TurnOff(_ *emptypb.Empty, ctx cluster.GrainContext) (*emptypb.Empty, error) {
    b.on = false
    return &emptypb.Empty{}, nil
}

func (b *Bulb) GetState(_ *emptypb.Empty, ctx cluster.GrainContext) (*GetStateResponse, error) {
    return &GetStateResponse{IsOn: b.on}, nil
}

func init() {
    SmartBulbFactory(func() SmartBulb { return &Bulb{} })
}
```

Register the grain kind when configuring the cluster:

```go
bulbKind := smartbulb.NewSmartBulbKind(func() smartbulb.SmartBulb { return &smartbulb.Bulb{} }, 0)
clusterConfig := cluster.Configure("ProtoClusterTutorial", provider, lookup, remoteConfig, cluster.WithKinds(bulbKind))
```

### Interacting with the grain

You can obtain a client for a specific smart bulb grain via the generated helper:

```go
bulbClient := smartbulb.GetSmartBulbGrainClient(c, "kitchen")
if _, err := bulbClient.TurnOn(nil); err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
state, _ := bulbClient.GetState(nil)
fmt.Println("Is on:", state.IsOn)
```

## Running multiple members

To showcase how grains work in a distributed system, run two instances of the application. Each instance will host grains and will be able to communicate with grains on other nodes.

Start the first node:

```bash
go run main.go
```

In another terminal, run the second node:

```bash
go run main.go
```

Try turning smart bulbs on and off from either node; state will be kept per grain identity across the cluster.

That's it – you've created and run your first grains in Proto.Actor using Go.
